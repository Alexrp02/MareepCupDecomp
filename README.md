# MareepCup Decomp
## What is?
This is a personal project made for playing a Pokemon randomlocke cup for friends.

## What does it have?
It is a fork of the pokeemerald-expansion project of github.
This project has an ingoing development of a custom hackrom made just for the cup. 
For that, there is a folder called _randomization_ that has all the necessary scripts written with Python to modify the code to make the game a randomlocke.
There is a folder called _savefile_tool_ that comes with an application written in Rust to get the team from a savefile in the showdown format.

## Main purpose of the project
The main purpose of the project is to learn to make a hackrom based on the decompilation of pokemon emerald and to learn some basic things about Python and Rust making some complementary tools.
